# Fountain Court Residents ‚Äì Rental & Tenant Management Web App

A web-based property management system that digitalizes Fountain Court‚Äôs rental workflow ‚Äî from online tenant application and ID verification to lease signing, payments, maintenance, and analytics.  
The app supports **three roles**: **Landlord**, **Tenant**, and **Repairman**, automating all communications, payments, and service tracking.

---

## üè° Overview

Fountain Court is a 40-unit residential property (20 one-bedroom, 15 two-bedroom, 5 three-bedroom units) that accommodates over 2 600 residents.  
Previously, all applications, leases, and payments were handled manually with paper records, causing errors, delays, and poor visibility.  
This web app centralizes those processes to improve efficiency, transparency, and tenant satisfaction:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
